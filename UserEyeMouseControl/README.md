## User Eye Mouse Controller
With the ubiquitous presence of desktops and laptops in professional and private settings, computers need to be accessible to everyone.  People who are unable to use computers are generally physically immobile or suffer from repetitive strain injury from using the mouse or track-pad of a computer.  This project aims to use the eyes as a way to control the computer's cursor using pupil detection via a novel hybrid algorithm that uses region extraction and the least point of intensity.  Hough circle estimation is used for voluntary blink detection which indicates a type of click to the computer (single or double click).  With minimal head movement and an initial calibration for pupil-to-computer mapping, the approach successfully allows a user to interact with his or her computer at about 20 frames per second (FPS).  This processing speed is more than enough to run in real-time on a standard computer's webcam.
